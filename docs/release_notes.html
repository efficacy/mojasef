<h2>Mojasef release notes: version 0.0.1.2 (2005/02/02)</h2>

<h3>About this release</h3>

<p>This release is the first "alpha" released to sourceforge and offered for initial
testing by a select group. The basic functionality should largely be there, but dark
corners are unexplored, and several key areas are still unimplemented.</p>

<h3>Changes since the previous version</h3>

<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known problems</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Sessions last forever</b>. I had to pull the session reaping code at the last minute,
so bear in mind that memory usage will grow if this server is left running.</li>
<li><b>Manual missing</b>. I thought I'd get this out for experimentation while I continue
with the manual. The examples give a brief overview, though.</li>
<li><b>Several spec handlers still unimplemented</b>. Several key spec suffix handlers still
need implementing including '#' (Map), '%' (Cache) , '+' (add), '&' (fallback), '*' (expand)</li>
<li><b>Simplistic Session cookie</b> The generated session cookie is just an incrementing number,
there may be problems with this.</li>
<li><b>Only HTTP/1.0</b> Mojasef does not support any HTTP/1.1 features such as "keepalive"</li>
<li><b>Apparent problem with nested tract templates</b>. During experimentation before release
a fault was discovered with the loading of tract attributes in nsted templates. This is not yet
covered by the test suite.</li>
<li><b>No Cookie utilities</b>. If you want to write cookies you're on your own. Mojasef needs
some cookie-building utility methods.</li>

</ul>
