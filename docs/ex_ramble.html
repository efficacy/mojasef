<a name='hello_world'><b>Hello World</b></a>

<p>In the time-honoured tradition, let's start with "hello, world". In keeping with the principles described
above, we want to be able to reuse as much as possible that we have learned before. So let's start with an
old "Hello.java" that we might have lying around after learning Java in the first place:</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
public class Hello
{
  public void sayhello()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Hello hello = new Hello();
    hello.sayhello();
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>To put this program on the web, we need to make the following changes to it: <i><b>none at all</b></i> :)</p>

<p>To use this program with Mojasef:
<ol>
<li>compile Hello.java so that you get a file Hello.class in your current directory
<li>run Mojasef using <p><tt>java -Dhttp.application$=Hello -jar moja-http.jar</tt></p>
<li>point your browser at <tt>http://localhost/sayhello</tt>
</ol>

<p>If all that went according to plan, you should see "Hello World!". That was pretty straightforward, wasn't it.</p>

<p>As an aside, note the "$", that little character is actually part of some key technology that gives mojasef
its simple and flexible configuration power. See the <a href='manual.html'>manual</a> for more
details.</p>

<a name='counting_hits'><b>Counting Hits</b></a>

<p>Now, this is pretty simplistic, so far. So let's tighten it up a bit. First, Our "Hello" application may only be a
dozen lines, but it's still too big. So let's remove some redundant code. We don't need any of that "main" nonsense,
becuse mojasef already knows how to create an object and call a method.</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
public class Hello
{
  public void sayhello()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>That all looks neat enough, but it doesn't actually <i>do</i> much so far. How about remembering things between
page requests? To keep it simple for this example, we'll just make it count accesses.</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void sayhello()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Try it. Stop the server (using Control-C, task manager or whatever), recompile Hello.java, and run Mojasef again.
Refresh your browser a few times to see that it really is counting. Cool. And <i>way</i> simpler than messing about
with the Servlet API.</p>

<p>OK, those of you with servlet experience might be beginning to worry. Relying on
member variables in a multi-threaded situation is extremely risky and a classic servlet problem. So this is a little
simplistic as it stands. If you are getting a lot of hits and you really care about your hit count being
"absolutely correct", you should probably wrap the increment in a synchronized block. On the other hand,
you could sidestep the problem by reading the next section.</p>

<a name='user_sessions'><b>User Sessions</b></a>

<p>Counting is good, but sometimes we don't want to share a single value. How about if we want to keep a
<i>separate</i> count for each visitor? This might seem tricky, but not in mojasef. Just run the server using:
<ul><tt>java "-Dhttp.application$=http.SessionWrapper Hello" -jar moja-http.jar</tt></ul></p>

<p>To test this yourself you will either need to access it from different machines, or using different browsers.
Firefox and Internet Explorer, for example. Point both your browsers at the same URL and try different
combinations of refreshing the page to prove to yourself that the counts really are independent.</p>

<a name='permanent_configurations'><b>Permanent Configurations</b></a>

<p>At this point I'd be getting fed up with typing such a long command line. Luckily Mojasef allows you to store stuff
like this in a file ready to be picked up when the server starts. Here's a simple way to do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a file in the current directory called "http.spec"
<li>put the following single line of text in it:
<p><tt>http.application$=http.SessionWrapper Hello</tt></p>
<li>Now you can run the server using:
<p><tt>java -jar moja-http.jar</tt></p>
</ol>

<a name='catching_all_accesses'><b>Catching all Accesses</b></a>

<p>While playing with this, you may have noticed that it's got a pretty narrow view of what URLs to respond to.
Anything other than <tt>/sayhello</tt> gets a 404 "not found" error. There are several ways to improve this, but
one of the simplest is to rename the method from <tt>sayhello()</tt> to <tt>request()</tt>. <tt>request()</tt> is
one of the method names that Mojasef looks for if it can't find a match on the URL.</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void request()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Now our server is much more polite. It will say "hello" to all visitors, whatever URL they ask for.</p>

<p>As an aside, Mojasef will always look for specific names before trying more general options like
<tt>request</tt>, so we can add another method:</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void request()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
  }

  public void secret()
  {
    System.out.println("you found the hidden page :)");
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Now pretty much every URL we can think of (such as <tt>http://localhost/wibble</tt>, or whatever) will give us
the "Hello, World" message , but if we happen on <tt>http://localhost/secret</tt> we get the other message. Anyone
for web services without all that fuss?</p>

<a name='finding_things_out'><b>Finding things out</b></a>

<p>Placing our raw objects on the web is a cool thing to do, but so far, not really as useful as the ugly Servlet API.
If nothing else we need to be able to look at the parameters passd to GET and POST requests, and maybe other things
such as request headers, cookies, and system configurations. Luckily, Mojasef comes to our aid with this too.</p>

<p>There are two major ways to get access to this kind of context information. I'll break with tradition in this
simple tutorial, and introduce both of them, so you can get the idea of the possibilities. For the first approach,
let's go back to our basic "hello" program and add a parameter to our method:

<div class='code'><pre>
import org.stringtree.StringFetcher;

public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void sayhello(StringFetcher context)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, we have <i>eventually</i> needed to import an extra class. Don't worry, though. This class doesn't
carry a lot of baggage. StringFetcher is a very simple interface consisting of two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>public Object getObject(String key);</tt></li>
<li><tt>public String get(String key);</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to fetch something in the form of a String from the surrounding context, use <tt>get(String key)</tt>.
This method returns the string value of the named context object, or the empty string ("") if not present.</p>

<p>If you want to fetch any other type of object, use <tt>getObject(String key)</tt> and cast the result if necessary.
Note that if there is nothing stored with the named key, this methjod will return <tt>null</tt>, so it can also be used
to check for the presence or absence of a value.</p>

<p>To compile this class you will need to make sure that StringFetcher is in your compilation classpath.
The simplest thing to do at the moment is to just put the whole <tt>moja-http.jar</tt> in the classpath.
Later, you may prefer to use the much "lighter" <tt>stringtree-if.jar</tt> from the Stringtree project,
which contains all the interfaces needed to write applications that use Mojasef, but contains no
implementation code to slow down and clutter up compilation.</p>

<p>To compile the class either place stringtree-if.jar or moja-http.jar in your classpath or use:</p>

<p><tt>javac -classpath moja-http.jar Hello.java</tt></p>

<p>As an aside, when Mojasef starts up, it will look for class directories and jar files in a <tt>lib</tt>
directory, so when you find that you want to use external APIs or libraries in your applications or
components, just pop them in there.</p>

<p>Now we have a context to look in, we really ought to use this new parameter to fetch some information. let's print
the originating IP address of the request and the browser identification header, and (to make our greeting more
personal), the value of a supplied "name" parameter.</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
import org.stringtree.StringFetcher;

public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void sayhello(StringFetcher context)
  {

    System.out.println("Hello, " + context.get("name");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
    System.out.println("from IP: " + context.get("remote.address"));
    System.out.println("browser: " + context.get("http.request.header.User-Agent"));
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>If you pop to the browser and request your mojasef URL (probably still <tt>http://localhost/sayhello</tt>),
you should see something starting with
<ul>Hello, visit number 1 from IP: </ul>
Now if you pass in a parameter by using <tt>http://localhost/sayhello?name=Frank</tt> You should see a message
starting with</p>

<ul>Hello, Frank visit number 2 from IP: </ul>

<p>If you want something other than an empty string to appear when no parameter is supplied, you can easily set
a default value in the same place you sett <tt>http.application</tt>. Add the following line to <tt>http.spec</tt> and
restart the server:

<p><tt>name=Mystery Guest</tt></p>

<p>Now, viewing <tt>http://localhost/sayhello</tt> gives:</p>

<ul>Hello, Mystery Guest visit number 1 from IP: </ul>

<a name='passing_things_back'><b>Passing things back to the server</b></a>

<p>This is all simple enough, but the output is beginning to look a bit messy. Despite using "println" to
put our text on separate lines, the web browser is treating it as HTML, and displaying it all on one line.
A simple way to fix this is to set the output "content type" to <tt>text/plain</tt> to override the default.
You may notice that the StringFetcher we are passing in to this method only has "get" methods, If we want
to be able to "<tt>put</tt>" output values as well, we need to pass in a <tt>StringRepository</tt> instead. Let's
modify our class by changing the import statement and the parameter declaration:</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
import org.stringtree.StringRepository;

public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void sayhello(StringRepository context)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + context.get("name");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
    System.out.println("from IP: " + context.get("remote.address"));
    System.out.println("browser: " + context.get("http.request.header.User-Agent"));
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>If you compile and run this, you'll notice that it behaves exactly as it did before. A StringRepository is also
a StringFetcher, and provides all the same methods and results. StringRepository also provides two extra methods,
with pretty obvious uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>public void put(String name, Object value);</tt></li>
<li><tt>public void remove(String name);</tt></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Actually, StringRepository also provides a <tt>clear()</tt> method, but using it in a Mojasef application
can be a very quick way to screw up your program unless you know exactly what you are doing.</i></p>

<p>To set the page content-type, let's add a line to put "text/plain" back into the context:</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
import org.stringtree.StringRepository;

public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void sayhello(StringRepository context)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + context.get("name");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
    System.out.println("from IP: " + context.get("remote.address"));
    System.out.println("browser: " + context.get("http.request.header.User-Agent"));

    context.put("http.response.header.Content-Type", "text/plain");
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Compile the class and restart the server. You should now see your messages in glorious plain-text-o-vision.</p>

<p>There are, of course, pleanty of other things you can put back into the context. Anything with a name starting with
<tt>http.response.header.</tt> will be sent as an outgoing header. You can set the HTTP response code
(e.g. 404 for missing page) using <tt>http.response.code</tt>, and set outgoing cookies by starting names with
<tt>http.response.cookie.</tt>. You can also set any other value you like, to be used in a page template, but <i>that</i>
will be introduced in a little while, below. For more details of any of this, see the <a href='manual.html'>manual</a>.</p>

<a name='sharing_context'><b>Sharing context between several methods</b></a>

<p>Remember I mentioned another way of getting information from the server?
If we want to keep our methods with no parameters (this is more usual when there are several
other pre-existing methods in the class which we also want to make available on the web), we can make use
of another mojasef feature. Before calling any method on our object, mojasef will first try the special method
<tt>warmup</tt>. Just as with <tt>request</tt>, mojasef will look for <tt>warmup(StringRepository context)</tt>,
<tt>warmup(StringFetcher context)</tt>, or <tt>warmup()</tt>. If you provide any of those public methods, mojasef
will call it, and you can keep a copy of the supplied context if you want:</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
import org.stringtree.StringRepository;

public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;
  StringRepository context;

  public void warmup(StringRepository context)
  {
    this.context = context;
  }

  public void sayhello()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + context.get("name");
    context.put("http.response.header.Content-Type", "text/plain");
  }

  public void secret()
  {
    System.out.println(context,get(name) + ", you found the hidden page :)");
  }
}
</pre></div>

<a name='nice_looking_pages'><p><b>Making nice-looking pages</b></p></a>

<p>Interesting as that side-trip into sending our page as plain text was, it's not much use for the
bulk of web pages. Most web pages use HTML, and use markup such as &lt;a href&gt; for links and &lt;p&gt;
for paragraphs. If we want to put this sort of stuff in our pages, we've got quite a few choices.
Popular approaches used with the Servlet API include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate HTML as strings in our application, e.g.
<tt>System.out.println("&lt;b&gt;this is important&lt;/b&gt;");</tt></li>
<li>Generate HTML using a special-purpose HTML-creation library (e.g.
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/ecs/index.html'>Jakarta ECS</a>)</li>
<li>Some form of "page compilation" such as <a href='http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/'>Java Server Pages</a></li>
<li>Some form of combined scripting/templating approach (e.g. <a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html'>velocity</a>,
<a href='http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/'>FreeMarker<a>, or <a href='http://www.webmacro.org/'>Webmacro</a>)</li>
<li>Generate an intermediate format (such as XML) in the code, and style it at run-time</li>
<li>Generate (roughly) plain text and run it through a markup inference process (e.g.
<a href='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TextFormattingRules'>Wiki markup</a> or
<a href='http://www.python.org/sigs/doc-sig/stext.html'>Structured Text</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are probably more. Realistically, you can use any of these with Mojasef, too. Mojasef also provides a few
alternative options that (I feel) integrate better with the core application. To the above choices, Mojasef adds:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Templates without scripting</b><br/>Mojasef includes a powerful template processing system with no need
for any kind of "embedded" scripting language. Common operations such as indexing through lists
and showing optional information are done using a kind of <i>algebra of templates</i>, More complex or
application-specific operations are written as regular Java, just like Mojasef applications and components.
Remember the principle of <i>self-similarity</i>.</li>
<li><b>build HTML by assembling HTML fragments</b><br/>Mojasef's powerful "spec" mechanism allows
large or small chunks of markup and text to be easily loaded from files, classpath resources or even remote URLs.</li>
</ul>

<p>To show how this works, let's go back a bit, to our application without the <tt>text/plain</tt>:</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
import org.stringtree.StringRepository;

public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void sayhello(StringRepository context)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + context.get("name");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
    System.out.println("from IP: " + context.get("remote.address"));
    System.out.println("browser: " + context.get("http.request.header.User-Agent"));
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Now imagine we wish to "wrap" this content in a nice HTML web page. Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure there is a directory called <tt>templates</tt> in the current directory.</li>
<li>Create a file <tt>default.tpl</tt> (in this case it could also be <tt>default.txt</tt> or <tt>default.html</tt>)</li>
<li>add the following to the new file:
<div class='code'><pre>
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A greeting from Mojasef&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;img src='http://www.stringtree.org/mojasef/images/mojasef.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
My name is Mojasef,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;${CONTENT}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div></li>
<li>Then (you don't need to restart the server) fetch the page <tt>http://localhost/sayhello</tt> again.
</ol>

<p>You should see a decorated page with the generated content nicely laid out in a preformatted block.
Try changing the template and fetch the page again. You should see it change each time. The important thing
to note about this is that you do not need to change the application to use different templates.</p>

<p>However, that's not all. Specifying such a <tt>default</tt> template causes it to be applied to all pages
generated by the application. This may be just what you want, but you may want something special for
some pages. There are a few ways of changing this.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can decide which template to use in your application
program:- put a value named <tt>page.template</tt> into the context, Mojasef will try and find a template
with the same name as the value. If you put a value named <tt>page.class</tt>, Mojasef will look in the
context or a value named <tt>template.class.<i>yourvalue</i></tt> and look for a template with the same name.</li>
<li>You can specify a template with the same name as your application method, and it will be used in preference
to the default.</li>
</ul>

<p>To show all these in action, let's add a few small methods to our application;</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
import org.stringtree.StringRepository;

public class Hello
{
  int n = 1;

  public void sayhello(StringRepository context)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + context.get("name");
    System.out.println("visit number " + n++);
    System.out.println("from IP: " + context.get("remote.address"));
    System.out.println("browser: " + context.get("http.request.header.User-Agent"));
  }

  public void ex1(StringRepository context)
  {
    System.out.println("This uses an explicit template");
    context.put("page.template", "whatever");
  }

  public void ex2(StringRepository context)
  {
    System.out.println("This uses a page class");
    context.put("page.class", "thing");
  }

  public void ex3(StringRepository context)
  {
    System.out.println("This uses a template with the same name");
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>If you compile this and restart the server, then fetch the pages (using, for example <tt>http://localhost/ex1</tt>)
you will see that they all still use the same default template. Mojasef tried to find the templates they ask for, but we
haven't created them yet, so it falls back to what it knows. We can add appropriate templates to the system and see them in action. I'll let you create
these templates as you like.  Just remember that the generated page content will appear wherever you put
<tt>${CONTENT}</tt>. Any other context value can also be displayed by placing its name between <tt>${</tt> and
<tt>}</tt>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a template (in the <t>templates directory, remember) called <tt>whatever.tpl</tt>, and fetch
<tt>http://localhost/ex1</tt></li>
<li>Add a line <tt>template.class.thing=whatever</tt> to <tt>http.spec</tt>, restart the server, and fetch
<tt>http://localhost/ex2</tt>. You'll see that it uses the template you just created.</li>
<li>Create a template called <tt>ex3.tpl</tt>, and fetch <tt>http://localhost/ex3</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If all you want to do is return some static text, or examine some context values, without even running
any application code, you can do that too.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a template called <tt>ex4.tpl</tt>, and fetch <tt>http://localhost/ex4</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<a name='magic_with_templates'><p><b>Magic with Templates</b></p></a>

<p>As a final twist, all the templates we have used so far are just what Mojasef considers <i>simple</i>
templates. Templates can be made much more powerful by <i>setting</i> and <i>invoking</i> context values in
the template itself, and by using the <i>algebra of templates</i> to process complex context values. More
details can be found in the <a href='manual.html'>manual</a>.

<p>Just to show how this can be useful, try the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a template called <tt>dump.tpl</tt> with the following text in it:
<ul><pre>
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan='2'&gt;Request Context - only available during a request&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
${request.context*row}

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th colspan='2'&gt;System Context - available at any time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
${system.context*row}

&lt;/table&gt;
</pre></ul></li>
<li>Create a template called <tt>row.tpl</tt> with the following text in it:
<ul><pre>
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;${CONTENT}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;${^CONTENT}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
</pre></ul></li>
<li>Fetch <tt>http://localhost/dump</tt></li>
<li>Marvel at the huge collection of context names and values for you to use in your
templates and applications.</li>
</ol>
