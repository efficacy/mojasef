<a name='what_are_we_trying_to_do'><b>What are we trying to do?</b></a>

<p>The real purpose of this tutorial is to show how you can use Mojasef in a realistic application.
In order to do that, however, let's pretend we want to create a little application to run a quiz.
Perhaps this a quiz for a bunch of students in a classroom, to check their progress on the subject of
today's lesson. It feels like an ideal first application for Mojasef.</p>

<p>The most important thing at this stage is not to get to grandiose and overcomplicated. We want to
be able to get something working as soon as possible. We'll start by thinking about some "user stories". </p>

<ul>
<li>Each student should enter his or her name at the start
<li>The application will show each question in turn and wait for an answer
<li>Each question will consist of a description and several possible answers
<li>To move on, a student must select one of the answers
<li>Students may progress through the questions at different rates
<li>When the final question has been answered the system will show the student a score
<li>Student answers will be written to a file so that the teacher can analyse the results later
</ul>

<p>Notice that at this stage we are not really interested in the details of how things look.
Mojasef allows us to defer that decision. All we need to make sure is that we have worked out the
information that needs to be shown, and we can sort out the details of how it will appear on the
screen by just tweaking with templates later. Without changing the working program.</p>

<a name='architecture'><b>Architecture</b></a>

<p>It seems from a first glance that there are several things that we might need in this
application:</p>

<ul>
<li>A bank of questions
<li>Somewhere to record student answers
<li>Something to keep track of who has attempted which questions
<li>A way to fetch questions in the correct order
<li>Something to work out each student's final score
</ul>

<p>We want this application to be as quick to put together as possible, so I suggest that we start by
looking at how much of this we have available already. With a bit of lateral thinking, I think we already
have two of these as part of Mojasef, ready to be reused.</p>

<a name='a_bank_of_questions'><b>A bank of questions</b></a>

<p>It might be tempting to dash off and create a new class to store a question. Before we do that, let's look
at what a question consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some descriptive text</li>
<li>two or more possible answers to select from</li>
<li>the correct answer (not shown to the student, used when calculating the score)</li>
</ul>

<p>If I were writing such a question down on paper, I might write something like:</p>

<div class='code'><pre>
Two trains start 100 miles apart, travelling toward each other on a straight track.
One train (train A) starts from Station A and travels at 50 miles per hour
One train (train B) starts from Station B and travels at 25 miles per hour
Where will the trains meet?

1. Half way between Station A and Station B
2. One third of the way between Station A and Station B
3. Two thirds of the way between Station A and Station B
4. Three Quarters of the way between Station A and Station B
answer: 3
</pre></div>

<p>If we turn this "upside down" (and slightly tweak with the format) we get:

<div class='code'><pre>
1: Half way between Station A and Station B
2: One third of the way between Station A and Station B
3: Two thirds of the way between Station A and Station B
4: Three Quarters of the way between Station A and Station B
answer: 3

Two trains start 100 miles apart, travelling toward each other on a straight track.
One train (train A) starts from Station A and travels at 50 miles per hour
One train (train B) starts from Station B and travels at 25 miles per hour

</pre></div>

<p>This type of text, with a group of "header" lines, follwed by a blank line, followed by
a chunk of multi-line "body" text should seem familiar. It's the same format used by the HTTP protocol
for both requests and responses. It's the same format used for email messages. It's even the same
format used by Mojasef for its own "advanced templates" and config files, as well as many other things.
This is a popular way to represent a very common data structure - a block of text with an arbitrary
number of name/value attributes. This idea is so common that Mojasef (or at least the
Stringtree library used by Mojasef) has special support for it. In Stringtree and Mojasef,
this data type is known as a Tract.</p>

<p>Mojasef already contains code to load, parse and store Tracts, so we might as well use that to
manage our bank of questions.</p>

<a name='a way_to_record_the_answers'><b>A way to record the answers</b></a>

<p>We don't really know what anyone will do with the results of these tests, but it's quite likely
that a teacher might want to use something like a spreadsheet to analyse them. With this in mind
it makes sens to write out the results in a format that suits loading into a spreadsheet. A common
way of storing information for use in a spreadsheet is what's known as a <i>CSV</i> file. This
consists of a bunch of lines, each line contains several fields separated by commas. Hence CSV -
"<b>C</b>omma <b>S</b>eparated <b>V</b>alues".</p>

<p>At this stage there is no need to read the answers back in to Mojasef, so we might as well just write them
out to a file as they come in. This begins to sound a lot like logging - another function commonly included
in servers and frameworks, so maybe we can re-use that too. Mojasef comes with the idea of logging, and one
of the supplied logger classes can be used to append lines to a file. All we need to do is to instantiate
such a logger object, point it at the output file, and make sure each line is correctly formatted. Luckily,
Mojasef's built-in template processing tools can be used just as easily for fine-grained work such as formatting
a line of data, as they can for producing complex web pages.</p>

<a name='keeping_track_of_questions'><b>Keeping trac of who has attempted which question</b></a>

<p>There are several ways we could approach keeping track of questions asked and answered. One of Mojasef's
strengths is the way that it allows any class to

Mojasef, I recommend that you head
